# Learning by Building C1 (Classification in Machine Learning 1)

This repo consists of all folders and files needed for the project of "Learning by Building" of [Classification in Machine Learning 1](https://algorit.ma/course/classification-1/) course at Algoritma.

The programming language used in this repo is R. I wrote an R markdown file of this repo. I published the Rmarkdown on RPubs. You can view it [here](https://rpubs.com/utomoreza/C1_LBB).

The dataset used is [Rain in Australia: Predict rain tomorrow in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) which is downloaded from Kaggle. Briefly, such dataset tells you whether it will rain or not tomorrow in Australia.

Feel free if you'd like to clone or download the repo.

Thanks for visiting my repo!
