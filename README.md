# Learning by Building C1 (Classification in Machine Learning 1)

This repo consists of all folders and files needed for the project of "Learning by Building" of [Classification in Machine Learning 1](https://algorit.ma/course/classification-1/) course at Algoritma.

The programming language used in this repo is R. I wrote an R markdown file of this repo. I published the Rmarkdown on RPubs. You can view it [here](https://rpubs.com/utomoreza/C1_LBB). Also, I published it in GitHub Page [here]()

The dataset used is [Connectionist Bench (Sonar, Mines vs Rocks)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)) which is downloaded UCI Machine Learning Repository. Briefly, such dataset tells you whether the sonar would result in mines or rocks.

Feel free if you'd like to clone or download the repo.

Thanks for visiting my repo!
